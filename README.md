# Convenient bits & bobs for Git

Git out-of-the-box isn't your best friend, git-convenience pulls together a few tools that make it that little bit more friendly. You get:

* Tab auto-completion
* A more useful command prompt
* Shortcuts to common operations

Works on OSX, Linux & Windows git-bash.

Trial it in your current terminal session:

```

```

If it works for you, have it in all your terminals:

```
eval "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakearchibald/git-convenience/master/setup.sh)"
```

## Shortcuts

* `gwut` - List all Git Convenience commands and prompt symbols
* `gs` - git status

* `gb` - git chckout -b (new branch)
* `gaa` - Add all changes (including untracted files) to staging
* `gc "Message"` - Commit all new files & changes with message

* `*` - Uncommitted changes
* `+` - Staged changes
* `%` - Untracked files
* `<` - You're behind the origin
* `>` - You're ahead of the origin
* `<>` - You've diverged from the origin
* `=` - You're up-to-date with the origin
